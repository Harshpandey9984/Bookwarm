# 🔧 Vercel Deployment Fix Applied

## ❌ **Previous Issue:**
The deployment failed due to dependency conflicts:
- `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers@3.0.7` requires `ethers@^6.1.0`
- Your project uses `ethers@5.7.2`
- This caused an ERESOLVE conflict during npm install

## ✅ **Fixes Applied:**

### 1. **Downgraded Dependencies**
- `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers`: `^3.0.7` → `^2.0.0`
- `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox`: `^2.0.0` → `^1.0.0`

### 2. **Added .npmrc**
```
legacy-peer-deps=true
auto-install-peers=true
```

### 3. **Added npm overrides**
```json
"overrides": {
  "ethers": "^5.7.2"
}
```

### 4. **Pushed to GitHub**
All changes are now on GitHub and will trigger auto-deployment.

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. **Vercel will auto-deploy** from GitHub (usually takes 2-3 minutes)
2. **Monitor deployment** in Vercel dashboard
3. **Get your live URL** once deployment completes

## 📋 **Alternative Deployment Method:**

If auto-deployment doesn't work, you can:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Find your project**: `bookwarm-blockchain`
3. **Click "Redeploy"** button
4. **Wait for completion**

## 🎯 **Expected Result:**
Your Bookwarm project should now deploy successfully without dependency conflicts!

## 🔗 **Your Project:**
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/Harshpandey9984/Bookwarm
- **Vercel Project**: bookwarm-blockchain
- **Live URL**: Coming soon! 🚀

The fixes have been applied and pushed to GitHub. Your project should deploy successfully now! 🎉
